Quantum computing uses qubits instead of classical bits. 
Qubits can exist in multiple states at once due to superposition.
This allows quantum algorithms like Shor's and Grover's to outperform classical computers.
Quantum entanglement enables correlation between particles even over distance.
These properties make quantum machines suitable for optimization, simulation, and cryptography tasks.
